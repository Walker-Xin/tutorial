# Second Year Talk Outline

Tentative title: *From Newton's Laws to Visualising Black Holes*.

We start with the classical mechanics idea that to determine the past, present and future of a particle's motion, we only need to know its position and velocity at some time. The rest can be determined by integrating Newton's laws of motion, which are second order differential equations.

Computers do a good job in solving DEs, but designing a good algorithm is the task of scientists. We will discuss the trivial Euler method and move on to Runge-Kutta methods and discuss the issue of adaptive step size. An illustration of the importance of adaptive step size can be made by considering a chaos system.

We then move to general relativity and the notion of geodesics, which in our case are the trajectories of photons. We will discuss the Schwarzschild metric and the geodesic equation (a generalisation of Newton's second law in curved spacetime). We will briefly discuss the accretion disk and how photons emitted by them allow us to 'see' black holes.

A short demonstration of the ray-tracing code will be given. A simple simulated image of a black hole will be shown. Finish with some scientific value of visualising BHs (determining BH spin, testing GR, etc.)
