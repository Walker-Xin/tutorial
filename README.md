# Tutorial Work for Physics

This repository contains the tutorial work for my Physics Course at Oxford.

## Potential Error

Please note that the solutions here are not official and may (and probably will) contain errors.

If any error is spotted, I would be very grateful if you could let me know by opening an issue.

## Course Structure

The course is split into 4 years.

### First Year

- CP1: Classical Mechanics, Special Relativity.
- CP2: Electromagnetism, Circuit Analysis, Optics.
- CP3: Complex Numbers, Linear Algebra, Ordinary Differential Equations.
- CP4: Calculus, Vector Calculus, Normal Modes & Waves.

### Second Year

- A1: Thermodynamics, Kinetic Theory, Statistical Mechanics.
- A2: Electromagnetism, Optics.
- A3: Quantum Mechanics.
- Mathematical Methods.
- Presentation on topic of choice.

## Utilities

Under `utilities` folder I provide `homework.sty` as a template for type setting tutorial work. While some mathematical commands are defined, I rarely use them and instead rely on snippets configured in VSCode for fast typing. Several sectioning commands such as `\problem` and `\subproblem` are defined to help structure the document. Two environments, `\mistake` and `\correction`, are used for reviewing tutorial work.

The template was inspired by the [resume template](https://github.com/TimmyChan/data-science-tech-resume-template) by Timmy Chan.

I also provide a 'tikz_plot.py' script for plotting simple functions using Python and TikZ. Please refer to [tikzplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/tikzplotlib/) for more information.

## Complimentary Notes

I plan to upload my self-made notes (written in markdown) once every academic year. The notes are often reproduced (almost verbatim) from standard textbooks recommended by the Oxford Physics course, although I try to maintain a consistent style of notation and level of detail across all subjects.

Although the notes should be much less error-prone, please take them with a grain of salt and notify me of any mistakes.
