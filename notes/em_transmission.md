# Electromagnetism - Transmission Lines

## Telegrapher's Equations

A transmission line consists of a conductor called the active wire that carries the voltage and current from the input to the output, and another conductor called the return path that is usually grounded. A lossless transmission line is characterised by its inductance per unit length $L$, capacitance per unit length $C$. The inductance is in series with the active wire, and the capacitance is across the active wire and the return path.

We consider an infinitesimal segment of the transmission line with length $\delta z$ and apply Kirchhoff's laws:

$$
\begin{split}
V(z + \delta z, t) &= V(z, t) - L \delta z \frac{\partial I(z, t)}{\partial t} \\
I(z + \delta z, t) &= I(z, t) - C \delta z \frac{\partial V(z, t)}{\partial t}
\end{split}
$$

which lead to the set of equations:

$$
\boxed{
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial V(z, t)}{\partial z} &= -L \frac{\partial I(z, t)}{\partial t} \\
\frac{\partial I(z, t)}{\partial z} &= -C \frac{\partial V(z, t)}{\partial t}
\end{split}
}
$$

These are called the telegrapher's equations. We can combine them to obtain the wave equations:

$$
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial^{2} V(z, t)}{\partial t^{2}} &= \frac{1}{LC} \frac{\partial^{2} V(z, t)}{\partial z^{2}} \\
\frac{\partial^{2} I(z, t)}{\partial t^{2}} &= \frac{1}{LC} \frac{\partial^{2} I(z, t)}{\partial z^{2}}
\end{split}
$$

which show that the voltage and current are travelling waves with speed $v = 1/\sqrt{LC}$.

## Infinite Transmission Line and Characteristic Impedance

Suppose an infinite transmission line starting from $z = 0$ is connected to a voltage source of frequency $\omega$ at $z = 0$. Since the line is infinite, we only consider the forward travelling waves:

$$
\begin{split}
V(z, t) &= V_{0} \cos{(\omega t - k z)} \\
I(z, t) &= I_{0} \cos{(\omega t - k z)}
\end{split}
$$

From the wave equations, we have $k = \omega \sqrt{LC}$. From the coupled equations, we have $k V_{0} = \omega L I_{0}$. We thus define the characteristic impedance of the transmission line as:

$$
Z_{0} \equiv \frac{V_{0}}{I_{0}} = \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}
$$

While the right-travelling waves satisfy $V/I = Z_{0}$, the left-travelling waves in fact satisfy $V/I = -Z_{0}$.

## Reflection at Loads

Now consider a finite transmission line of characteristic impedance $Z_{0}$ and length $l$ with a load $Z_{\text{out}}$ at the end. Let us locate the origin at the load. In general the load reflects some of the signal generated by the source. The waves are given by:

$$
\begin{split}
\tilde{V}(z, t) = V_{+} e^{i(\omega t - k z)} + \tilde{V}_{-} e^{i(\omega t + k z)} \\
\tilde{I}(z, t) = I_{+} e^{i(\omega t - k z)} + \tilde{I}_{-} e^{i(\omega t + k z)}
\end{split}
$$

Noe that $V_{+}$ and $I_{+}$ are real amplitudes of the forward waves where as the reflected waves may have complex amplitudes due to a phase shift. Let us define $V_{0} \equiv V_{+}$ and $\tilde{\Gamma} \equiv \tilde{V}_{-}/V_{+}$, where $\tilde{\Gamma}$ is called the reflection coefficient. We have:

$$
\begin{split}
\tilde{V}(z, t) &= V_{0} \left[ e^{i(\omega t - k z)} + \tilde{\Gamma} e^{i(\omega t + k z)} \right] \\
\tilde{I}(z, t) &= \frac{V_{0}}{Z_{0}} \left[ e^{i(\omega t - k z)} - \tilde{\Gamma} e^{i(\omega t + k z)} \right]
\end{split}
$$

At the load which is located at $z = 0$, we must have $\tilde{V}(0, t)/\tilde{I}(0, t) = Z_{\text{out}}$. This gives:

$$
\frac{1 + \tilde{\Gamma}}{1 - \tilde{\Gamma}} Z_{0} = Z_{\text{out}}
$$

which can be solved for $\tilde{\Gamma}$:

$$
\boxed{
\tilde{\Gamma} = \frac{Z_{\text{out}} - Z_{0}}{Z_{\text{out}} + Z_{0}}
}
$$

While the characteristic impedance is generally real, the load impedance may be complex, which then leads to a complex reflection coefficient. We can also define the input impedance $Z_{\text{in}}$ the ratio of the voltage and current at the input $z = -l$:

$$
\begin{split}
Z_{\text{in}} &\equiv \frac{\tilde{V}(-l, t)}{\tilde{I}(-l, t)} \\
&= Z_{0} \frac{1 + \tilde{\Gamma} e^{-2 i k l}}{1 - \tilde{\Gamma} e^{-2 i k l}} \\
&= Z_{0} \frac{Z_{\text{out}} \cos{kl} + i Z_{0} \sin{kl}}{Z_{0} \cos{kl} + i Z_{\text{out}} \sin{kl}}
\end{split}
$$

where we have made use of the expression for $\tilde{\Gamma}$.

Note that when $Z_{0} = Z_{\text{out}}$, we have $\tilde{\Gamma} = 0$ and there is no reflection. The input impedance is then $Z_{\text{in}} = Z_{0}$, which is the same as the characteristic impedance of the transmission line. This is called impedance matching.

In fact, we can extend this discussion to the connection of two transmission lines of characteristic impedances $Z_{1}$ and $Z_{2}$. To the left of the junction $z = 0$, we have:

$$
\begin{split}
\tilde{V}(z, t) &= V_{I} e^{i(\omega t - k_{1} z)} + V_{R} e^{i(\omega t + k_{1} z)} \\
\tilde{I}(z, t) &= \frac{V_{I}}{Z_{1}} e^{i(\omega t - k_{1} z)} - \frac{V_{R}}{Z_{1}} e^{i(\omega t + k_{1} z)}
\end{split}
$$

whereas to the right of the junction $z = 0$, we have:

$$
\begin{split}
\tilde{V}(z, t) &= V_{T} e^{i(\omega t - k_{2} z)} \\
\tilde{I}(z, t) &= \frac{V_{T}}{Z_{2}} e^{i(\omega t - k_{2} z)}
\end{split}
$$

At $z = 0$, we must let the voltage and current be continuous. This gives the solutions:

$$
\begin{split}
V_{R} &= \frac{Z_{2} - Z_{1}}{Z_{1} + Z_{2}} V_{I} \\
V_{T} &= \frac{2Z_{1}}{Z_{1} + Z_{2}} V_{I}
\end{split}
$$

Notice that by setting $Z_{2} = Z_{\text{out}}$, we recover the results for the finite transmission line.
